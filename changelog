% Change log from v0.99 to v0.991
% [*] Removed the slice offset in adaptive combine. It was used to make
%	  sure that no border effects occur in calculation of the weighting
%	  factors. However, this is actually not necessary as no border
%	  effects occur.
%     The offset flag should be removed in the next release entirely.
% [*] Added free and estimated memory to 'initializeParallel.m' to be
%     displayed.
% [*] Added 'shortFilename' flag in setOptions to shorten the
%     filename to the unambigous minimum discarding all names given by
%     the parameters.
% [*] Many undocumented changes...
% [*] Many minor bug fixes.

% Change log from v0.98 to v0.99
% [*] Implementated GRAPPA reconstruction using Michael Lustig's code.
% [*] Changed the way the amount of slices and chunks is estimated for
%     autoSetup.
% [*] Renamed number of workers and split the sliceWorkers (now it's
%     preproc, proc and combineWorkers).
% [*] Added an option to change the maximum number of potential CPUs.
% [*] Changes made to displaySettings in case of denoising with BM4D.
% [*] Changes made to displaySettings to indicate where and how files
%     are written to disk.
% [*] Changed channel combintion from being a parameter to an option.
% [*] Changed denoising filter type from being a parameter to an option.
% [*] Implemented wavelet denoising from André Pampel (MPI Leipzig,
%     Germany).
% [*] Implemented 3D phase correction from André Pampel (MPI Leipzig,
%     Germany).
% [*] Renamed function 'initializeParallel' to 'initializeProcess'.
% [*] Added a few sanity checks in setupPipeline and initializeProcess.
% [*] Made a few changes to setup variables correctly.
% [*] Many minor bug fixes.
%
% Change log from v0.97 to v0.98
% [*] Added function 'procRawdata.m' to conduct phase unwrapping of
%     uncombined data.
% [*] Added option to write phase data in 'writeNIfTI.m'.
% [*] Fixed a bug in 'getMaxChannel.m' if processed without
%     parallelization.
% [*] Added folder 'processingPipeline' for cleaner look.
% [*] Separated pre-processing and processing of raw k-space into two
%     functions called 'preprocRawdata.m' and 'procRawdata.m'.
% [*] Added functionality to process data without writing intermediate
%     results to disk for faster processing. -> procMemory in
%     'setOptions.m'
% [*] Added function 'initializeParallel.m'.
% [*] Removing several outputs in 'displaySettings.m' regarding parallel
%	  processing.
% [*] Changed output of progress to a simple progress bar.
% [*] Added output of image information.
% [*] Minor bug fixes.
%
% Change log from v0.96 to v0.97
% [*] Minor changes in 'setupPipeline.m' regarding reference data.
% [*] Minor changes in 'statusData.m' regarding writing NIfTI files.
% [*] Minor changes in 'writeNIfTI.m'.
% [*] Re-implemented distortion correction. Needs a reference images to 
%     run appropriately as the image's origin is still not set correctly.
% [*] Fixed minor issues in 'applyBiasCorrection.m' and sub-functions.
% [*] Corrected estimation of used memory during processing.
% [*] When option to use reference file is used, a window to select the
%     file will pop up during 'setupPipeline.m'
% [*] Added 'getStarted.m' function to make 'startReconstruction.m'
%     cleaner.
%
% Change log from v0.95 to v0.96
% [*] Saving a mat-File in reconstruction folder containing the settings,
%     which can also be used as a preset to run exact same pipeline again.
% [*] Added function to clean up at end of pipeline. During clean up the
%     parallel pool is closed and all intermediately written files may be
%     removed.
% [*] Added option to remove all intermediately written files at the end of
%     the pipeline.
% [*] Added function 'createPreset.m' to create preset.
% [*] Added presets of settings (and made according changes thoughout the
%     script). To use a preset specify its name at the beginning of 
%     'startReconstruction.m'.
% [*] Fixed a bug in the naming scheme.
% [*] Changed settings to settings.options.
% [*] Added option to automatically set number of workers, chunks, and
%     slices according to available memory and number of physical CPUs.
% 
% Change log from v0.94 to v0.95
% [*] Added if statement in 'setupPipeline.m' to automatically change
%     settings in case of partial Fourier or if partial Fourier was falsely
%     selected for non partial Fourier data.
% [*] Added logical statement in 'extractRawdata.m' to avoid multying
%     everything with 0 in case decorrelation was set to true without
%     having noise data.
% [*] Removed option to remove readout oversampling after pre-processing
% [*] Fixed a bug in 'loadData.m' > 'adaptComb' related to indexing.
% [*] Fixed a bug in 'applyDenoising.m' which resulted in Fourier
%     transformation along one direction only, instead of in 3D.
% [*] Added more comments
% 
% Change log from v0.93 to v0.94
% [*] Fixed a bug if number of workers times stepSize would be greater than
%     nSlc
% [*] Fixed a bug preventing processing with a single CPU
% [*] Implemented use of denoising algorithms by Coupé et al.
% [*] Minor changes.
% 
% Change log from v0.92 to v0.93
% [*] Added path to twix_obj, now allowing to load data from different
%     folders.
% [*] Changes made in 'installReconstructionPipeline.m' as folders were
%     missing and the folder of the tissue probability map of SPM was set
%     up falsely.
% [*] Folder to save data has to be specified in
%     'installReconstructionPipeline.m'
% [*] Added a parameter to save files in a user specified folder. (Default:
%     home/user/data/MRI/)
% [*] Changed loading of noise data for decorrelation according to 
% [*] Changed parameters.nSlc to parameters.pSlc in 'statusData.m' > 
%     'kspace'
% 
% Change log from v0.91 to v0.92
% [*] Changed extraction of twix_obj as some fields are not always filled
%     to be set as parameters (e.g., number of channels, slices, etc)
% [*] Changed variables in 'setupPipeline.m' for partial Fourier 
%     reconstruction accordingly
% [*] Changed variables in 'loadData.m' > 'kspace_decor' from parameters.n*
%     to parameters.p*
% [*] Changed variables in 'applyTukeyfilter.m' from parameters.n* to
%     parameters.p*
% [*] Added parameters struct in 'partialReconstruction.m' to get the
%     index correctly.
% [*] Renamed 'decorrelateChannels.m' to 'extractRawdata.m'
